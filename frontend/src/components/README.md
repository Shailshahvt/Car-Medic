# Components Directory

Contains React custom components used in the application, like custom maps in our case.

## Considerations

- Each component must have its own directory with naming convention of camelCase (first word is in small case and following words have their first letter capitalized).
- The code is placed in index.jsx or index.tsx
- Example:
  - MechanicsMap
    - index.jsx
